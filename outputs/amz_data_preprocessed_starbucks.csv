"0 Balance, Alert.  I purchased 10 25 Starbucks cards on Amazon to give away at Christmas time.  I have already had one person call me from inside the Starbucks store where they tried to make a purchase.  The Starbucks store told them there was a zero balance on the card.  All the cards arrived looking nice, new still in the package, each individually packaged.  I gave away several and have no way of knowing if other people experience the same problem unless they tell me.  I got the person to take a picture of the back of the card so I could see the serial number.  I called Starbucks and told them I had purchased it on Amazon along with several others.  The customer service person at Starbucks was able to tell that it should have a 25 balance but was never activated and that the card came from a Safeway store.  They could also tell the person I gave it to had just tried to make a purchase but the purchase never went through because the card was never activated.  I had one of the cards left I was keeping for myself and checked it while I was on the phone with Starbucks and it was a good card with a 25 balance.  Coincidently, I looked at the the list of serial numbers that I supposedly received from Amazon and the card I kept was on there but the serial number of the unactivated card was not listed as one they sent.  It almost seems that one or more bad cards were mixed in with the stack of cards I purchased.  Now Im going to have to replace that gift plus track down the ones I gave away.  I buy a lot of products on Amazon and purchase a lot of gift cards every year to give to employees and other people.  I'm not happy and want someone to fix this.

"Twas the night before xmas.  I purchased three of the multipacks containing four cards each.  The plan was to save time during the busy holiday season by not having to go into Starbucks to buy gift cards.  Plus I would receive them quickly using Amazon Prime.  On xmas eve, I opened the packages, thinking I would quickly put together these gifts for my grandkids.  One thing I didn't consider was that there would be no gift envelopes to put the cards into, so I had to make my own.  This was time consuming which defeated the purpose of ordering the cards online.  But the most annoying thing was that I could hardly pull the cards apart due to the incredibly sticky glue that held them together.  Once I got them apart, the glue remained on multiple spots on each card.  I rubbed and scrubbed to get the sticky mess off but eventually gave up.  The cards ended up looking dirty and used and remained sticky.  Not the look I was going for as a gift.  In the end, I would have preferred to go to a local Starbucks to buy individual gift cards.
