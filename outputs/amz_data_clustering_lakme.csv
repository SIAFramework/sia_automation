"A gorgeous performance of a most delightful opera.

"A gorgeous performance of a most delightful opera.  I first heard the flower duet of this opera with which is among the most beautiful works I've ever heard, and the bell song is also impressive.  takes it faster than Sutherland, and, although I'm a huge Sutherland fan, has a voice more appropriate for the role and sings comfortably in french, whereas Sutherland is more of an italianate performer.  So for the soprano's performance alone, has an edge over other recordings the third I know of, besides Sutherland's and Mesple's recordings of the opera, is one with Robin, but that recording is somewhat dated--1952 I believe.
