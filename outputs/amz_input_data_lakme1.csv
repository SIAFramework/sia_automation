Indeed after Tchaikovsky had heard one of Delibes' ballets he is said to have remarked that ""if I had known that this music existed I would not have written Swan Lake"". Obviously Delibes vocal compositions were created in the French language and for the French voice. Some of his most beautiful melodic writing for the voice is evident in Lakme. Arguably Mady Mesple was THE French coloratura of the middle Twentieth Century. She had a beautiful voice; sweet and pleasing to the listener. In this Opera set in India the five principle singers are French and sing the original French composition. The vocal sound is just more pleasing sung by the native French in their own language.",Delibes: Lakmé - Highlights,https://www.amazon.com/Delibes-Lakm%C3%A9-Highlights-Mady-Mespl%C3%A9/product-reviews/B000002S1Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,16,"['https://www.amazon.com/Delibes-Lakm%C3%A9-Highlights-Mady-Mespl%C3%A9/product-reviews/B000002S1Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1', 'https://www.amazon.com/Delibes-Lakm%C3%A9-Highlights-Mady-Mespl%C3%A9/product-reviews/B000002S1Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=2']",https://www.amazon.com/Delibes-Lakm%C3%A9-Highlights-Mady-Mespl%C3%A9/product-reviews/B000002S1Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1|https://www.amazon.com/Delibes-Lakm%C3%A9-Highlights-Mady-Mespl%C3%A9/product-reviews/B000002S1Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=2,0,https://www.amazon.com/Delibes-Lakm%C3%A9-Highlights-Mady-Mespl%C3%A9/product-reviews/B000002S1Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1

Mesple takes it faster than Sutherland, and, although I'm a huge Sutherland fan, Mesple has a voice more appropriate for the role and sings comfortably in french, whereas Sutherland is more of an italianate performer. So for the soprano's performance alone, Mesple has an edge over other recordings (the third I know of, besides Sutherland's and Mesple's recordings of the opera, is one with Robin, but that recording is somewhat dated--1952 I believe). If highlights doesn't do it for you, go for the full version (I found that at CD now, and I go with it since I wanted the whole opera, but it's almost 3 times more expensive, so it really just depends how enthusiastic about this opera you are.

Indeed after Tchaikovsky had heard one of Delibes' ballets he is said to have remarked that ""if I had known that this music existed I would not have written Swan Lake"". Obviously Delibes vocal compositions were created in the French language and for the French voice. Some of his most beautiful melodic writing for the voice is evident in Lakme. Arguably Mady Mesple was THE French coloratura of the middle Twentieth Century. She had a beautiful voice; sweet and pleasing to the listener.

Mesple takes it faster than Sutherland, and, although I'm a huge Sutherland fan, Mesple has a voice more appropriate for the role and sings comfortably in french, whereas Sutherland is more of an italianate performer. So for the soprano's performance alone, Mesple has an edge over other recordings (the third I know of, besides Sutherland's and Mesple's recordings of the opera, is one with Robin, but that recording is somewhat dated--1952 I believe). If highlights doesn't do it for you, go for the full version (I found that at CD now, and I go with it since I wanted the whole opera, but it's almost 3 times more expensive, so it really just depends how enthusiastic about this opera you are.
